    <string name="fake_long_text">The keyPositionType of parentRelative uses the same coordinate system as the screen. It defines (0, 0) to the top left of the entire MotionLayout, and (1, 1) to the bottom right.

You can use parentRelative whenever you want to make an animation that moves through the entire MotionLayout – like the moon arc in this example.

However, if you want to modify a path relative to the motion, for example make it curve just a little bit, the other two coordinate systems are a better choice.
